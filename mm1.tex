\footnote{Authors are in alphabetical order
unless there is an extraordinary reason to do otherwise.  Also,
the author address includes a department \emph{only} if
the department is \emph{not} mathematics. We use as few
footnotes as possible in the \textit{Magazine}.  This one, for instance,
contains information that really belongs in the body of the paper.
The previous footnote probably belongs among the Acknowledgments at the end.}\\

This document is meant to help you prepare an Article for
submission to \textsc{Mathematics Magazine}.  Of course,
editorial decisions depend entirely on
what you say and how you say it. Nonetheless, we will all save
time if you exercise some care in how you first present the paper.\cite{adams1995hitchhiker}
